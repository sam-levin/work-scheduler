# work-scheduler
This is a project for the UCB Coding Bootcamp

## Features
This uses Jquery and Moment JS to create a daily work scheduler
It uses local storage to store tasks with a time
Every day it will reset to have empty tasks
It uses moment.js to determine if a time block is in the past, in the future, or in coming due soon, and uses bootstrap to adjust color accordingly
